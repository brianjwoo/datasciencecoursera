# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data

Within this folder, I have included the scripts and data generated within R as part of the project to combine and annotate the raw data that is provided by UCI's Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. The purpose of their project was to collect measurements using a smartphone's accelerometer while a number of different individuals performed a variety of activities.

The provided data set was provided as a training and test set, along with the variable names and activity labels in different files. Our task was to combine them into one large table, and take the columns corresponding to either the mean or standard deviation. We were also asked to take the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. A codebook which contains some of the variable names is also included to interperet the meaning of the columns.
